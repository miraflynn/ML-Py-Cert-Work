    "- first unsupervised learning model\n",
    "- only works for specific types of problems\n",
    "- used when you have a bunch of input features but no labels/output info\n",
    "- finds clusters of like datapoints and tells you location\n",
    "- steps:\n",
    "    1. randomly pick k points to place k centroids\n",
    "    2. assign all of the data points to the centroids by distance\n",
    "    3. Average all of the point locations belonging to each centroid to find the middle of those clusters, place the corresponding centroids into that position\n",
    "    4. repeat steps 2-3 until no point changes which centroid it belongs to"
