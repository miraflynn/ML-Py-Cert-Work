    "## Hidden Markov Models\n",
    "- have been using models that rely heavily on data\n",
    "- hidden markovs use probability distributions\n",
    "- ex. weather model, predict weather on a given day given the probability of different events occuring\n",
    "    - if sunny, 80% chance that next will be sunny\n",
    "- how do we know probability of event? Sometimes calculated from dataset\n",
    "    - not gonna go into that, gonna use predefined probability distributions\n",
    "- Formal definition: \"A Hidden Markov Model is a finite set of states, each of which is associated with a (generally multidimensional) probability distribution p. Transitions among the states are governed by a set of probabilities called transition probabilities\"\n",
    "- weather model states can be hot day and cold day\n",
    "    - hidden because we never actually access/look at the states while we interact with the model, instead look at observations\n",
    "    - observation example: If it is hot outside, Tim has an 80% chance of being happy, if cold, then 20% chance of being happy\n",
    "    - probability we can use: on a sunny day, the prob of between 5-15 deg celsius with an average of 11 degrees\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data we use\n",
    "- constant values for transition distributions and observation distributions\n",
    "- States: in each markov model, we have a finite set of states.\n",
    "- Observations: each state has a particular outcome or observation associated with it based on a probability distribution\n",
    "- Transitions: each state will have a probability defining the likelihood of transitioning to a different state\n",
    "- To make a hidden markov model we need States, Observation Distribution, and Transition Distribution"
